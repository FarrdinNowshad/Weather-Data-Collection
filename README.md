# Home Weather Station

This project is a simple Home Weather Station that reads temperature, humidity, pressure, altitude, and air quality using an Adafruit BMP280 sensor, DHT11 sensor, and MQ2 sensor. The data is sent to the Blynk cloud service, allowing you to monitor the weather conditions remotely.

## Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE installed
- Blynk library installed
- Adafruit BMP280 library installed
- DHT sensor library installed
- WiFi library installed
- ESP32 board selected in Arduino IDE

## Hardware Setup
1. Connect the BMP280 sensor to the appropriate pins on your ESP32 board.
2. Connect the DHT11 sensor to the specified pin on your ESP32 board.
3. Connect the MQ2 sensor to the specified pin on your ESP32 board.
4. Ensure your ESP32 is connected to the internet.

## Configuration
1. Replace the placeholders in the code with your Blynk template ID and authentication token.
   ```cpp
   #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "Your_Template_ID"
   #define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "Your_Auth_Token"
   ```
2. Set your WiFi credentials.
   ```cpp
   char ssid[] = "Your_WiFi_SSID";
   char pass[] = "Your_WiFi_Password";
   ```

## Running the Code
1. Upload the code to your ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Open the Serial Monitor to view the sensor readings and ensure there are no errors.
3. Open the Blynk app on your mobile device and add the widgets for temperature, humidity, pressure, altitude, and air quality using the corresponding virtual pin numbers (V0-V4).
4. Monitor the weather conditions remotely through the Blynk app.

## Troubleshooting
- If the BMP280 sensor is not detected, check the wiring or try a different address.
- Ensure that the Blynk template ID and authentication token are correct.
- Check the serial monitor for any error messages.
